# MultiLayerPerceptron - Task3
Multi-layer perceptron using backpropagation on penguins' data

## Task Overview
- Backpropagation is a method used in artificial neural networks to calculate a gradient that is needed in the calculation of the weights to be used in the network.
- The goal of the backpropagation training algorithm is to modify the weights of a neural network in order to minimize the error of the network outputs.

## Dataset (Penguins)
- The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Penguins (Adelie, Gentoo and Chinstrap).  
- Five features were measured from each sample: bill_length, bill_depth, flipper_length, gender and body_mass, (in millimeter).
